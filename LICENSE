6.  GENERAL PROVISIONS

        a.  Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
            under the internal laws of the British Virgin Islands, regardless

        b.  Dispute Resolution. Licensee (i) hereby irrevocably and
            unconditionally submits to the jurisdiction of the relevant courts
            of the British Virgin Islands for the purpose of any dispute,

            Agreement or the matters contemplated by this Agreement
            (“Disputes”), (ii) agrees not to commence any suit, action or

            proceeding, any claim that it is not subject personally to the
            jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is
            exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the suit,
            action or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the
            venue of the suit, action or proceeding is improper or that this
            Agreement or the subject matter hereof or thereof may not be
            enforced in or by such court.

            Each party will bear its own costs in respect of any Disputes.

            Notwithstanding the foregoing, at the Licensor’s sole option and
            commencing within a reasonable period from the date of
            notification to the other party of such Dispute, any Dispute may
            be resolved by confidential, binding arbitration to be seated in
            the British Virgin Islands and conducted in the English language
            by a single arbitrator pursuant to the rules of the International
            Chamber of Commerce (the “Rules”). The arbitrator shall be
            appointed in accordance with the procedures set out in the Rules.
            The award or decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding
            upon the parties and the parties expressly waive any right under
            the laws of any jurisdiction to appeal or otherwise challenge the
            award, ruling or decision of the arbitrator. The judgment of any
            award or decision may be entered in any court having competent
            jurisdiction to the extent necessary. If the Licensor elects to
            have a Dispute resolved by arbitration pursuant to this provision,
            no party hereto shall (or shall permit its representatives to)
            commence, continue or pursue any Dispute in any court.

            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
            Agreement, the Licensor shall at all times be entitled to obtain
            an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
            and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof, this
            being in addition to any other remedy to which the Licensor is
            entitled at law or in equity, and the parties hereto hereby waive
            the requirement of any undertaking in damages or posting of a bond
            in connection with such injunctive relief or specific performance.

            EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES ITS RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM
            OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR
            THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF. THE SCOPE OF THIS WAIVER IS INTENDED TO
            BE ALL-ENCOMPASSING OF ANY AND ALL DISPUTES THAT MAY BE FILED IN
            ANY COURT AND THAT RELATE TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF ANY OF THE
            TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
            LIMITATION, CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE),
            BREACH OF DUTY CLAIMS, AND ALL OTHER COMMON LAW AND STATUTORY
            CLAIMS. THIS SECTION HAS BEEN FULLY DISCUSSED BY EACH OF THE
            PARTIES HERETO AND THESE PROVISIONS WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO ANY
            EXCEPTIONS. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY FURTHER WARRANTS AND
            REPRESENTS THAT SUCH PARTY HAS REVIEWED THIS WAIVER WITH ITS LEGAL
            COUNSEL, AND THAT SUCH PARTY KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVES ITS
            JURY TRIAL RIGHTS FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL COUNSEL.

        c.  Class Action Waiver. No Class Actions Permitted. All Licensees
            hereby agree that any arbitration or other permitted action with
            respect to any Dispute shall be conducted in their individual
            capacities only and not as a class action or other representative
            action, and the Licensees expressly waive their right to file a
            class action or seek relief on a class basis. LICENSEES SHALL
            BRING CLAIMS AGAINST LICENSOR ONLY IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY,
            AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR
            REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.

            Agreements if Class Action Waiver Unenforceable. If any court or
            arbitrator makes a final, binding and non-appealable determination
            that the class action waiver set forth herein is void or
            unenforceable for any reason or that a Dispute can proceed on a
            class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall
            be deemed null and void with respect to any Dispute that would
            thus be required to be resolved by arbitration on a class basis,
            and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate
            such Dispute. In the event that, as a result of the application of
            the immediately preceding sentence or otherwise, any Dispute is
            not subject to arbitration, the parties hereby agree to submit to
            the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of and venue in the
            federal and state courts located in the British Virgin Islands and
            to accept service of process by mail with respect to such Dispute,
            and hereby waive any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses
            otherwise available with respect to such Dispute.

        d.  Amendment; Waiver. This Agreement may be amended and provisions
            may be waived (either generally or in a particular instance and
            either retroactively or prospectively), only with the written
            consent of the Licensor.

        e.  Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
            found invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any
            jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
            the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the validity or
            enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
            situation or in any other jurisdiction. If a final judgment of a
            court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or
            provision hereof is  invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto
            agree that the court making such  determination shall have the
            power to limit such term or provision, to delete specific  words
            or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or
            provision with a  term or provision that is valid and enforceable
            and that comes closest to expressing  the intention of the invalid
            or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be
            enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does not
            exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the
            parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable term
            or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that
            will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and
            other purposes of such invalid  or unenforceable term or provision.

        f.  Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement
            and understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter
            hereof and supersede any and all prior negotiations,
            correspondence, warrants, agreements, understandings duties or
            obligations between or involving the parties with respect to the
            subject matter hereof.

        g.  Delays or Omissions. No delay or omission to exercise any right,
            power, or remedy accruing to any party under this Agreement, upon
            any breach or default of any other party under this Agreement,
            shall impair any such right, power, or remedy of such
            non-breaching or non-defaulting party, nor shall it be construed
            to be a waiver of or acquiescence to any such breach or default,
            or to any similar breach or default thereafter occurring, nor
            shall any waiver of any single breach or default be deemed a
            waiver of any other breach or default theretofore or thereafter
            occurring. Any waiver, permit, consent or approval of any kind or
            character on the part of any party of any breach or default under
